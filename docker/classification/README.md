# Transfer-learn a classification model and compile for Edge TPU (TF1)

The scripts in this directory provide everything you need to perform
transfer learning on a quantization-aware image classification model, using
TensorFlow 1.x.

To run the scripts on your local hardware, clone this repository and
then follow the walkthrough at
[coral.ai/docs/edgetpu/retrain-classification/](https://coral.ai/docs/edgetpu/retrain-classification/).
